# Bosch QA Failure Capstone â€“ Sample Data & Extraction Script

This repository contains data and scripts for Step 2 of my Capstone Project in the Machine Learning Engineering & AI Bootcamp.

##  Project Overview

**Capstone Theme:** Predicting QA Failures from Test Log Data  
**Main Dataset:** [Bosch Production Line Performance â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bosch-production-line-performance/data)

In real-world manufacturing or embedded QA workflows (like aerospace and defense software testing), failure patterns can often be predicted from early-stage logs. 
This project aims to explore machine learning methods to model those patterns using real-world industrial data.
